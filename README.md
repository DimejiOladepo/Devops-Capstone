# Devops-Capstone
Rolling Deployment using AWS EKS, Cloudformation, Nginx, Jenkins, Docker and Kubernetes. 

I used Jenkins pipelines to automate the rolling deployment and continuous integration of a nginx web file on AWS VPC and ELB using 
docker to build and containerize the working image and AWS EKS to provision the container and make it highly available. I also
used cloudformation scripts to spin up resources on AWS.
